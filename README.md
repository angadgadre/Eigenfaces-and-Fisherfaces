Eigenfaces-and-Fisherfaces
==========================

Human face recognition and detection

To implement two algorithms, namely the Eigenfaces and Fisherfaces algorithms, for face recognition with the Yale face database. To perform experiments in order to find out the average misclassification rates or in other words the error rate while using these algorithms and discuss their resulting implications for the given pattern recognition task.
