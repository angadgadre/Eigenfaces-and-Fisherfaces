Eigenfaces-and-Fisherfaces
==========================

Human face recognition and detection

To implement two algorithms, namely the Eigenfaces and Fisherfaces algorithms, for face recognition with the Yale face database. To perform experiments to find out the average misclassification rates using these algorithms and discuss their implications.
